==== Resolved issues

* BPM-203 https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/BPM-203[Multi-tenancy support]
+
BProc addon can work together with the https://www.cuba-platform.com/marketplace/multitenancy[multi-tenancy] addon. If the multi-tenancy addon is added to the project then BProc screens (modeler, user tasks, process definitions, process instances, etc.) will take user's tenantId into account.

* BPM-206 https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/BPM-206["Extension properties" panel for User Task elements]
+
A special panel is added to the User Task element in the modeler. This panel allows you to add any metadata to the User Task element that later can be retrieved using the `com.haulmont.addon.bproc.service.BprocModelService#getElementExtensionProperties` method.

* BPM-284 https://youtrack.cuba-platform.com/issue/BPM-284[It's impossible to add design-time security roles to user groups]

==== Important Notes

Database schema has been changed. Don't forget to update the database.

[discrete]
==== Breaking Changes

`UserGroup` and `ContentStorage` entities now implements the `TenantEntity` interface. This means that if you had the multi-tenancy addon in your project then be prepared that `UserGroup` and `ContentStorage` will be managed taking the tenantId attribute into account.

[discrete]
==== Breaking Changes

. `bproc_ModelerScreen` screen ID has been changed to `bproc_BpmnModelerScreen`. If you have security roles that grant permissions to this screen, you have to update the roles.

. `modeler` UI component has been renamed to `bpmnModeler`. If you have screens with the `modeler` component, you have to change the component name.

==== BPMN Viewer UI Component

The BPMN Viewer UI component has been introduced. It can be used to display a read-only BPMN process diagram. The component has methods to highlight any model element. An example of its usage can be found in the *Process Instance Editor* screen. A new tab *Diagram* displays a process model with the highlighted active node.
