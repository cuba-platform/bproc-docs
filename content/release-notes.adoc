==== Breaking Changes

. Some screen ids have been changed. If you have securiy roles that grant permissions to these screens, you'll have to update the roles. Modified screens ids:
+
* `bproc_ModelerScreen` -> `bproc_BpmnModelerScreen`

. `modeler` UI component has been renamed to `bpmnModeler`. If you had screens with the `modeler` component on them, you'll have to change the component name.

An example of its usage can be found in the process istance editor. A new tab called *Diagram* appeared there and it highligts active nodes.
