== Quick Start

This section describes how to model and run a simple business process for reimbursement.

Three persons will be involved in the process:

* an employee who asks for reimbursement
* a manager who approves the reimbursement
* an accountant who actually transfers money to employee account

The model that we are going to create:

image::quick-start/reimbursement-process-model.png[]

Let's start modeling the process. Open the _BProc > Modeler_ screen.

When the modeler is first opened, the properties panel on the right displays properties of the process itself. Modify the fields:

* _Process id_: `reimbursement`
* Process _Name_: `Reimbursement`

Find the _Documentation_ text area in the properties panel and write a process description there:

image::quick-start/process-documentation.png[]

Click on the `StartEvent` element. Properties of the start event element will be displayed on the properties panel. The _Form_ section is used to describe a form that will be displayed to users when they start the process. There are two types of process forms: _Dynamic_ and _Custom_. A dynamic process form is a form whose fields are defined in the process model and such form is generated in the runtime when the process is started. A custom form is a reference to a standard framework screen (see the <<process-forms>> section for details). In this tutorial we'll define a dynamic start process form. 

Create a new form field. In the field editor specify the following field properties:

image::quick-start/expense-amount-field-editor.png[]

Create the _expenseDate_ field with the `Date` type and the _document_ field with the `File` type.

After that create a field _manager_ with a `User` type. For the `User` type additional fields are displayed in the editor: they are used for specifying a UI component for user selection (lookup field or picker field) and an optional JPQL query for filling the lookup field or a screen for selecting users in case of picker fields. We'll use the the `LookupField` component and will leave the _JPQL query_ field blank - that means that the default query `select e from sec$User e` will be used.

Form fields section should look this way:

image::quick-start/start-event-form-fields.png[]

When a process is started all form field values will be written into process variables. Field ids will be used as variable names.

After you've specified all start form fields create the `Approval` user task. If the start event node is selected on the canvas, you may click the _Append task_ icon in the popup menu:

image::quick-start/start-event-append-task.png[]

Then click the _Change type_ icon (a wrench) and select a _User Task_ there.

image::quick-start/user-task-change-type.png[]

Type a task name: `Approval`. You can do that both right on the element node or in the _Name_ field of the properties panel. In the properties panel specify a task id: `approval`.

There are several ways to specify task assignee (see <<single-user-assignment>>). In this current case, we'll use the `Form field` assignee source. After you select this source a _Form field_ lookup field will be displayed. All form fields with the type `User` will be displayed there. We have only one such field, it is `manager` defined in the start event process form. Select it.

image::quick-start/approval-task-assignee.png[]

For the `Approval` task we must also specify a process form. In this form we'll display some values from the start form and one new field. For selecting an existing form field use the ellipsis button.

image::quick-start/form-field-ellipsis-button.png[]

The dialog displays form fields declared in other elements of the process. You can select multiple fields here. Press the *Ctrl* key and select `expenseAmount`, `expenseDate` and `document` fields. 

image::quick-start/select-form-fields-approval.png[]

After you close the dialog these fields will appear in the fields list. For each field open the field editor and unselect the _Editable_ checkbox. This will make field components read-only. We don't want the manager to modify the values, just to view them.

Add a new field with the `comment` id and the `Multiline string` type. This field will be used by the manager to make some notes when approving or rejecting the reimbursement request.

At the `Approval` step the manager has two options: to `Approve` and to `Reject` the request. An easy way to support this in a dynamic form is to use outcomes (for details see <<user_task_outcomes>>). For each outcome a button will be displayed on the dynamic form and the result will be stored in a special process variable.

Create new outcome using the corresponding button of the _Outcomes_ section. In the outcome editor specify an outcome name `approve`, a caption `Approve` and select an icon `CHECK` in the icons list.

image::quick-start/approve-outcome-edit.png[]

Then create a second outcome: the name is `reject`, the caption is `Reject`, the icon is `BAN`.

After the `Approval` task is completed, the process must decide which path to chose using the outcome value. Let's create an exclusive gateway. Click the `Approval` task element and click the `Append Gateway` action of the context menu.

image::quick-start/approval-task-append-gateway.png[]

Two sequence flows should leave the exclusive gateway: one for `EndEvent` element and another for new user task called `Payment`. Give names to sequence flows: `approved` and `rejected`. 

image::quick-start/reimbursement-process-model.png[]

To specify a condition for the `approved` flow, click on the element and in the sequence flow properties panel select the `Task outcome` value in the _Condition source_ lookup field. Select an `Approval` user task and the `approve` outcome.

image::quick-start/approved-sequence-flow-properties.png[]

Do the same for the `rejected` sequence flow, but select a `reject` outcome value for it. 

For the `Payment` task we will implement the following behavior: the task should be displayed for all accountants and any of them will be able to take this task for himself. To achieve this we should not specify a particular assignee for the user task, but should specify _Candidate groups_ or _Candidate users_. We'll use the _Candidate groups_ option, but first we must create a user group for accountants. User groups are managed using the _BProc > User Groups_ screen (read more about user groups here: <<user-groups>>). Open the user groups screen and create a new group called `Accountants`. Change group type to `Users` and add several users to the group. Commit the screen and go back to the modeler. 

image::quick-start/accountants-user-group-edit.png[]

In the modeler click the edit button near the _Candidate groups_ field. The dialog will be opened. The _Groups source_ value should be `User groups`. Add the `Accountants` group and close the dialog.

image::quick-start/payment-task-candidate-groups.png[]

Configure a dynamic form for the `Payment` task. Add existing `expenseAmount`, `expenseDate`, `document` and `comment` fields using the ellipsis button of the `Form fields` section.

The last thing we need do is to specify who can start this process. Click on the free space on the canvas to display process properties. Similar to the `Payment` task we'll define _Candidate groups_ in the _Started candidates_ section. 

image::quick-start/process-starter-candidates.png[]

If we want the process to be started by any user we may create and use a special user group. Open the `User groups` screen and create a new group called `All users`. Set its _Type_ to `All users`, this will mean that this group will automatically include every user. In the modeler select the `All users` group for process starter candidates.

image::quick-start/all-users-group-edit.png[]

The process model is ready to be deployed to the process engine. Click the `Deploy process` button on the buttons toolbar.

image::quick-start/deploy-process-button.png[]

To start the process open the _BProc > Start Process_ screen. This screen displays process definitions available for starting by the current user. Double click on the `Reibursement` process line or select it and click the _Start process_ button. 

A start form will appear. Fill the fields, select the manager and click the _Start process_ button. 

image::quick-start/start-process-form.png[]

The manager will see assigned tasks in the _BProc > My Tasks_ screen.

image::quick-start/my-tasks-screen.png[]

Double-click on the task.

image::quick-start/approval-task-form.png[]

Some fields on this form are read-only as we configured in the modeler and there are two buttons for outcomes: _Approve_ and _Reject_. Enter the comment and click the _Approve_ button.

Log in on behalf of any user who is a member of the `Accountants` user group. Open the _BProc > My Tasks_ screen. You'll see that the table is empty, but in the filter there is an indicator that the user has a _group task_ that can be claimed. Select the _Group tasks_ type and click the _Apply_ button.

image::quick-start/my-tasks-payment.png[]

All users of the `Accountants` group will see the `Payment` task among their group tasks until any of accountants claims it. Open the task form. The form is read only - you cannot do anything with the task until you claim it. On the bottom of the form there are two buttons: _Claim and continue_ and _Claim and close_. 

image::quick-start/payment-task-claim-form.png[]

_Claim and continue_ button will remove the task from group task lists of other users and will leave the task form on the screen. The form will become editable and buttons for completing the task will be displayed.

_Claim and close_ will remove the task from other users task lists, the process form will be closed. The task will appear in the _Assigned tasks_ list for the current user. Click the _Claim and close_ button.

Select the _Assigned tasks_ task type on the filter panel and click the _Apply_ button. Open the form and complete the task using the default _Complete task_ button (when we don't specify outcomes this single button is displayed).

The process is completed.
