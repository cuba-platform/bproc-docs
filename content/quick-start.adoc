== Quick Start

This section describes how to model and run a simple business process for a refund.

Three persons will be involved in the process:

* an employee who asks for the refund;
* a manager who approves the refund;
* an accountant who actually transfers money to employee account.

The model that we are going to create:

image::quick-start/refund-process-model.png[]

Let's start modeling the process. Open the *BProc -> Modeler* screen.

When the modeler is first opened, the properties panel on the right displays properties of the process itself. Modify the fields:

* *Process id*: `quick-start-refund`
* *Process Name*: `Quick start refund`

image::quick-start/modify-process-id.png[]

Find the *Documentation* text area in the properties panel and write a process description there:

image::quick-start/process-documentation.png[]

Click on the `StartEvent` element on the canvas. Properties of the `StartEvent` element will be displayed on the properties panel. The *Form* section is used to describe the form that will be displayed to users when they start the process. There are several values available under the *Form type* drop-down list:

* *No form* — a process should be started programmatically.

* *Input dialog* — form fields are defined in the process model. The form is generated in the runtime when the user starts a process or completes a user task.

* *CUBA screen* — a reference to a standard framework screen (see the <<cuba-screen-process-form>> section for details).

* *Custom* — used if you need to render a form in a non-standard way (see the <<custom-process-form>> section for details).

Let's specify the *Input dialog* as a start process form. Select the *Input dialog* form type.

Create a new input dialog parameter. In the *Input Dialog Parameter Editor* specify the following properties:

image::quick-start/request-number-field-editor.png[]

Note that the *Process variable* lookup field allows you to enter the value in it. If you want to associate the dialog parameter with the process variable that hasn't been used before, then type the variable name and press Enter. If you want to display an existing variable, select its name from the drop-down list (we'll see it shortly).

Create three more input dialog parameters:

* `expenseAmount` (type is `Decimal (double)`, editable and required)
* `expenseDate` (type is `Date`,  editable and required)
* `document` (type is `File`,  editable and required)

After that create an input dialog parameter `manager` with the `User` type (it must be required and editable). For the `User` type, additional fields are displayed in the editor: they are used for specifying a UI component for user selection (lookup field or picker field) and an optional JPQL query for filling the lookup field or a screen for selecting users in case of picker fields. We'll use the `LookupField` component and will leave the *JPQL query* field blank — that means that the default query `select e from sec$User e` will be used.

Input dialog parameters section should look this way:

image::quick-start/start-event-form-fields.png[]

On the bottom of the panel there is a *Business key* lookup field. A business key is a domain-specific identifier of a process instance. Select the `requestNumber` field.

When a process is started input dialog parameters will be written into corresponding process variables.

After you've specified the start form, create the *Approval* user task. If the start event node is selected on the canvas, you can click the *Append task* icon in the pop-up menu:

image::quick-start/start-event-append-task.png[]

Then click the *Change type* icon (a wrench) and select the *User Task* there.

image::quick-start/user-task-change-type.png[]

Type a task name: `Approval`. You can do that both right on the element node or in the *Name* field of the properties panel. 

On the properties panel specify a task id: `approval`.

There are several ways to specify task assignee (see <<single-user-assignment>>). In this current case, we'll use the `Process variable` assignee source. After you select this source a `Process variable` lookup field will be displayed. All form fields and process variables with the type `User` will be displayed there. We have only one such field, it is `manager` defined in the start event process form. Select it.

image::quick-start/approval-task-assignee.png[]

For the `Approval` task we also must specify a process form. It will be an input dialog again. The dialog will display process variables from the start event form and one more new parameter. 

Create a new input dialog parameter and in the *Process variable* drop-down list select the `requestNumber` variable.

image::quick-start/existing-variable-input-dialog-param-edit.png[]

Make the field non-editable by unselecting the *Editable* check box.

In the same way create input dialog parameters for `expenseAmount`, `expenseDate` and `document` variables. They all must be non-editable.

Add a new dialog parameter with the `comment` process variable name and the `Multiline string` type. The field must be editable and non-required. This field will be used by the manager if the manager wants to make some notes when approving or rejecting the refund request.

At the `Approval` step, the manager has two options: to `Approve` and to `Reject` the request. An easy way to support this is to use outcomes (for details see <<user-task-outcomes>>). For each outcome a button will be displayed on the form and the result will be stored in a special process variable.

Create a new outcome using the corresponding button of the *Outcomes* section. In the outcome editor specify an outcome id `approve`, a caption `Approve` and select an icon `CHECK` in the icons list.

image::quick-start/approve-outcome-edit.png[]

Then create a second outcome: the id is `reject`, the caption is `Reject`, the icon is `BAN`.

After the `Approval` task is completed, the process must decide which path to chose using the outcome value. Let's create an exclusive gateway. Click the *Approval* task element and click the `Append Gateway` action of the context menu.

image::quick-start/approval-task-append-gateway.png[]

Two sequence flows should leave the exclusive gateway: one for `EndEvent` element and another for new user task called `Payment`. Give names to sequence flows: `approved` and `rejected`. 

image::quick-start/refund-process-model.png[]

To specify a condition for the `approved` flow, click on the element and in the sequence flow properties panel select the `Task outcome` value in the *Condition source* lookup field. Select an `Approval` user task and the `approve` outcome.

image::quick-start/approved-sequence-flow-properties.png[]

Do the same for the `rejected` sequence flow, but select a `reject` outcome value for it. 

For the `Payment` task, we will implement the following behavior: the task should be displayed for all accountants and any of them will be able to take this task for himself. To achieve this we should not specify a particular assignee for the user task but should specify *Candidate groups* or *Candidate users*. We'll use the *Candidate groups* option but first, we must create a user group for accountants. User groups are managed using the *BProc -> User Groups* screen (read more about user groups here: <<user-groups>>). Open the user groups screen and create a new group called `Accountants`. The group code is `accountants`. Change group type to `Users` and add several users to the group. Commit the screen and go back to the modeler. 

image::quick-start/accountants-user-group-edit.png[]

In the modeler click the edit button near the *Candidate groups* field. The dialog will be opened. The *Groups source* value should be `User groups`. Add the `Accountants` group and close the dialog.

image::quick-start/payment-task-candidate-groups.png[]

Configure an input dialog for the `Payment` task. Add existing `requestNumber`, `expenseAmount`, `expenseDate`, `document` and `comment` fields. Make them all non-editable.

The last thing we need do is to specify who can start this process. Click on the free space on the canvas to display process properties. Similar to the `Payment` task we'll define *Candidate groups* in the *Starter candidates* section. 

image::quick-start/process-starter-candidates.png[]

If we want the process to be started by any user we may create and use a special user group. Open the `User groups` screen and create a new group called `All users`. Set its *Type* to `All users`, this will mean that this group will automatically include every user. In the modeler select the `All users` group for process starter candidates.

image::quick-start/all-users-group-edit.png[]

The process model is ready to be deployed to the process engine. Click the `Deploy process` button on the buttons toolbar.

image::quick-start/deploy-process-button.png[]

To start the process open the *BProc -> Start Process* screen. This screen displays process definitions available for starting by the current user. Double click on the `Refund` process line or select it and click the *Start process* button. 

A start form will appear. Fill the fields, select the manager and click the *Start process* button. 

image::quick-start/start-process-form.png[]

The manager will see assigned tasks in the *BProc -> My Tasks* screen.

image::quick-start/my-tasks-screen.png[]

Double-click on the task.

image::quick-start/approval-task-form.png[]

Some fields on this form are read-only as we configured in the modeler and there are two buttons for outcomes: *Approve* and *Reject*. Enter the comment and click the *Approve* button.

Log in on behalf of any user who is a member of the `Accountants` user group. Open the *BProc -> My Tasks* screen. You'll see that the table is empty, but in the filter, there is an indicator that the user has a group task that can be claimed. Select the *Group tasks* type and click the *Apply* button.

image::quick-start/my-tasks-payment.png[]

All users of the `Accountants` group will see the `Payment` task among their group tasks until any of accountants claims it. Open the task form. The form is read-only - you cannot do anything with the task until you claim it. On the bottom of the form there are two buttons: *Claim and resume* and *Claim and close*. 

image::quick-start/payment-task-claim-form.png[]

*Claim and resume* button will remove the task from group task lists of other users and will leave the task form on the screen. The form will become editable and buttons for completing the task will be displayed.

*Claim and close* will remove the task from other users task lists, the process form will be closed. The task will appear in the *Assigned tasks* list for the current user. Click the *Claim and close* button.

Select the *Payment* tasks node from the *Assigned tasks* group. Open the task form and complete the task using the default *Complete task* button (when we don't specify task outcomes in the model, this default button is displayed).

The process is completed.
