== Process Forms

Process forms are screens displayed to users. They may be configured for `StartEvent` and `UserTask` model elements. There are two process form types: _dynamic_ and _custom_.

[[dynamic-process-form]]
=== Dynamic Process Form

Fields of dynamic forms are defined right in the process model. If you click on `StartEvent` or `UserTask` model element, then on the properties panel you will be able to configure fields types, ordering and other parameters. When users start processes or complete tasks, dynamic forms are automatically rendered based on the configuration you provided in the model.

The form field editor looks as follows:

The _id_ property will be used as a process variable name when the form is commited, e.g. the value of the field _orderNo_ will be written to the process variable with the _orderNo_ name. If the form is opened for a user task and a process variable with a given name already exists, its value will be set to the form field UI component.

Supported form field types are:

* string
* multi line string
* number
* boolean 
* date
* date with time
* user
* user list
* entity
* entity list
* file
* platform enum
* custom enum

Depending on the selected type, additional components may be displayed. For example, for _entity_ and _entity list_ types you should select an entity class from the dropdown list, a UI component (LookupField or PickerField) and optionally a lookup screen or JPQL query (default values will be used if these fields are left blank).

A _user_ and _users list_ field types work like fields with _entity_ and _entity list_ types with the `sec$User` meta class. An additional piece of functionality in the modeler related to these field types is that for `UserTask` elements you can select such form fields as UserTask assignee value.

[[custom-process-form]]
=== Custom Process Form

If you need a process form with a complex layout or behavior then instead of dynamic process form (which are defined right in a process model) you may use custom process forms. A custom process form is a regular UI screen. If a form should be used for starting a process, its controller should be annotated with the `@StartProcessForm` annotation. If a form is for user tasks completion then use the `@TaskProcessForm` annotation.

==== Custom Start Process Form Example

Here is an example of a simple start process forms that displays components for entering a string with a contract number and a lookup field for selecting a user who should approve the document.

Start process form screen class must have the `@StartProcessForm` annotation. Only screens with this annotation are displayed in the process forms lookup in the modeler.

The screen should also implement the `ProcessFormContextAware` interface with the single `void setProcessFormContext(ProcessFormContext processFormContext)` method. When the process form is opened the `ProcessFormContext` object is set. The `ProcessFormContext` contains an information about a process to be started or a user task to be completed and methods for working with them (start process, complete task, etc). Without the `ProcessFormContext` the process form is barely useful.

A `@ProcessVariable` annotation may be placed on UI components (_orderNumber_ and _approverLookup_) and regular class fields (_oderDate_). It indicates that the value of the UI component or class field will be written to a process variable when the process is started using the form.

A `@ProcessVariable` annotation may have an optional `name` attribute. The value of this attribute is the process variable name where the field or UI component value will be written to (_approver_). If the `name` attribute is missing, then a field name is used (_orderNumber_ or _orderDate_) for a process variable name.

The `processFormContext.startProcess()` method starts the process using annotated process variables. The `ProcessFormContext` class has a couple alternative methods for starting the process:

* `void startProcess(String businessKey)` - this method set a business key when starting the process. The process variables are collected from the annotated class fields.

* `void startProcess(String businessKey, Map<String, Object> processVariables)` - use this method if you want to collect a map with process variables manually.

`ProcessFormContext` has a method for getting a `ProcessDefinitionData` object that holds an information about the process to be started: `ProcessDefinitionData getProcessDefinitionData()`.

Task process form screen class must have the `@TaskProcessForm` annotation. Only screens with this annotation are displayed in the process forms lookup in the modeler. An optional `outcomes` annotation attribute declares a list of possible task outcomes. These outcome names will be used in the modeler when you specify a condition for a sequence flow node. See the <<user_task_outcomes>> section.

The `@ProcessVariable` annotation, in addition to functions described in the <<custom_start_process_form_example>> section, do some additional work. If by the moment the task form is opened, some process variable already has a value, then this value will be set into UI component or class field.

Just like start process form, task process forms should implement the `ProcessFormContextAware` interface. A `ProcessFormContextAware` object that is set when a task form is opened contains a `TaskData` object holding all the information about a user task and methods for working the the task.

For tasks, the `ProcessFormContextAware` class contains the following methods:

* `completeTask()` - completes the task without any outcome and using the process variables collected from annotated fields.
* `completeTask(Map<String, Object> processVariables)` - completes the task without any outcome and using the explicitly passed process variables map.
* `completeTaskWithOutcome(String outcome)` - completes the task with an outcome and using the process variables collected from annotated fields.
* `completeTaskWithOutcome(String outcome, Map<String, Object> processVariables)` - completes the task with an outcome and using the explicitly passed process variables map.

`ProcessFormContext` has a method for getting a `TaskData` object that holds an information about the user task to be completed: `TaskData getTaskData()`.
