[[introduction]]
== Introduction

*BProc* add-on is used for modeling and running business processes. Processes are described using BPMN 2.0 notation. The add-on uses https://flowable.org/[Flowable] as a business process engine and https://bpmn.io/[bpmn-js] rendering toolkit for process modeling.

This manual mostly describes features added by the add-on, not features provided by underlying frameworks, so you must be familiar with the https://www.flowable.org/docs/userguide/index.html[Flowable] engine.

== Installation

=== Installation of Trial Version

In case you've got a trial version of the add-on and have a ZIP file with artifacts, follow the instructions:

1. Create a directory called `repository` in the root directory of your project. 

2. Unzip the file with artifacts into this directory. You should get the following directory structure:
+
image::structure.png[]
+
3. Register the new Maven repository in the `build.gradle` file.
+
[source]
----
repositories {
        maven {
            url './repository'
        }
}
----
+
4. Go to *CUBA -> Marketplace* in the main menu.
+
image::main-menu.png[]
+
5. Click the *Gear* icon in the upper-right corner, then *Install by coordinates…*
+
image::gear.png[]
+
6. Enter coordinates of the latest add-on version. Copy coordinates from the *Component Coordinates* section on the page of the add-on on the https://www.cuba-platform.com/marketplace/[marketplace]. 
+
image::copy-coordinates.png[]
+
7. Add `.trial` at the end of the coordinates, for example:
+
image::coordinates.png[]
+
8. Click *OK* and *Apply*. The installation will start.

=== Installation of Purchased Add-on

If you have a subscription for the add-on, you need to add premium repository and then install the add-on. Follow the steps below to install the add-on in your project.

==== Adding Repository

1. Open your application in CUBA Studio.

2. Double-click *Properties* in the CUBA project tree.

4. Specify the repository URL:
+
 * https://cuba-platform.bintray.com/premium, if the main repository is Bintray
 * https://repo.cuba-platform.com/content/groups/premium, if the main repository is repo.cuba-platform.com

+
5. Enter your credentials in the corresponding fields. The first part of your license key before dash is the repository user name, the part after dash is the password. For example, if your key is `111111222222-abcdefabcdef`
* For Bintray repository user name - `111111222222@cuba-platform`, password - `abcdefabcdef`
* For repo.cuba-platform.com user name - `111111222222`, password - `abcdefabcdef`

[[user-task]]
== User Task

[[single-user-assignment]]
=== Single User Assignment

There are several ways to specify a task assignee. You can expand the *Assignee source* drop-down list on the UserTask element properties panel and find the follows:

* *Expression*
+
You will need to write an expression that evaluates an id of the User who must be an assignee. If you know that a user entity is stored in a process variable called `manager` then the expression will be `${manager.id}`. You also may invoke Spring bean method that returns a user id: `${demo_MyBean.evaluateManager(methodParam1, 'methodParam2')}`
+
* *Process variable*
+
If you select the `Process variable` assignee source then the *LookupField* component will be displayed in the element properties panel. This lookup field will contain all process variables with the `User` type (input dialog parameters with the `User` type and process variables with the `User` type defined in the *Start event* properties panel). A process may be started programmatically without using the start process form and process variables values may be passed using the API. In this case, if you need to assign a user task to the person from one of the process variables, you can either write an explicit expression for the assignee or add an info about the process variable to the *Process variables* section.
+
* *User provider*
+
If the assignee is evaluated in runtime you may use a user provider. User providers are Spring beans that implement the `UserProvider` interface. An interface has a `User get(String executionId)` method. The method returns a User who should become a task assignee. Here is an example of a user provider that reads a process variable with the user login and finds a user with this login in the database.
+
[source,java]
----
@Component("ref_MyUserProvider")
public class MyUserProvider implements UserProvider {

    @Inject
    private DataManager dataManager;

    @Inject
    private BprocRuntimeService bprocRuntimeService;

    @Override
    public User get(String executionId) {
        String userLogin = (String) bprocRuntimeService.getVariable(executionId, "userLogin");
        return dataManager.load(User.class)
                .query("select u from sec$User u where u.login = :login")
                .parameter("login", userLogin)
                .one();
    }
}
----

TIP: A `UserProvider` class must be placed to the *core* module.

[[multi-instance-tasks]]
=== Multi-instance Tasks

A user task may be assigned not to a single user, but to multiple users as well. For example, you may need several people to approve the contract. Approvers may do their work in parallel or one after another. See link:{flowable_doc_url}#bpmnMultiInstance[Multi-instance (for each)] section of Flowable documentation for basic information.

Let's look at the user tasks element in process XML:

[source,xml]
----
<userTask id="someTask" name="Some Task" flowable:assignee="${assignee}">
  <multiInstanceLoopCharacteristics isSequential="true"
     flowable:collection="${collectionVariable}" flowable:elementVariable="assignee" >
  </multiInstanceLoopCharacteristics>
</userTask>
----

In the modeler, you'll have to fill the expression for the *Collection* field of the *multiInstanceLoopCharacteristics* element and the *elementVariable* field. After that use the `elementVariable` value as an `assignee` for the user task element.

BProc modeler helps you to fill all these attributes in case you have a list of users in the form field or in the process variable. A user task model element (as long as ServiceTask, Sub-process, and some other elements) has a *Multi instance* section in the properties panel. When you change the multi-instance type from *None* to *Parallel* or *Sequential*, new fields appear on the panel. Let's suppose that in the start process form you defined a field `lawyers` with the `User list` type. This field value holds a collection of users. For the current user task you may select a *Process variable* collection source and then select a `lawyers` field in the *Process variable* lookup.

image::multi-instance-panel.png[]

If you do that the system will suggest you fill *Сollection*, *Element variable* and *Assignee expression* fields mentioned above automatically.

image::collection-expression-changed-dialog.png[]

[[task-candidate-users-and-groups]]
=== Task Candidate Users and Groups

For the user task you may specify a list of potential task assignees (see the link:{flowable_doc_url}#bpmnUserTaskAssignment[User assignment] section of the Flowable documentation). A task with candidates appears in the *Group tasks* list for each candidate. After any of the candidates claims the task, the task moves to the *Assigned tasks* list of the user who claimed the task and disappears from the *Group tasks* list of other candidates.

Candidates are defined using *Candidate groups* or *Candidate users* fields on the user task properties panel.

In the *Candidate groups edit* dialog, the *Group source* should be defined. The possible group source values are:

* *User groups*. A list of `UserGroup` should be selected. See the <<user-groups>> section for the information about user groups.
* *User groups provider*. Use this type if the groups should be evaluated programmatically. A Spring bean that implements the `UserGroupListProvider` interface should be selected. The bean must implement the `List<UserGroup> get(String executionId)` method that evaluates and returns a list of user groups. The bean must be located in the *core* module.
* *Expression*. Explicitly provide an expression used by the process engine. The expression should return a list o user group ids. It will be written to the `flowable:candidateGroups` attribute of the `<userTask>` element.

In the *Candidate users edit* dialog the *Users source* should be defined. The possible source values are:

* *Users*. A list of `User` should be selected.
* *Users provider*. Use this type if the users list should be evaluated programmatically. A Spring bean that implements the `UserListProvider` interface should be selected. The bean must implement the `List<User> get(String executionId)` method that evaluates and returns a list of users. The bean must be located in the *core* module.
* *Expression*. Explicitly provide an expression used by the process engine. The expression should return a list of user ids. It will be written to the `flowable:candidateUsers` attribute of the `<userTask>` element.

[[user-task-outcomes]]
=== User Task Outcomes

When users complete user tasks they often have to make some decision (approve or reject, yes or no, etc.). After they do it, the process should go one or another way. You may use task outcomes for modeling such cases. For *Input dialog* process forms outcomes are defined in the *Outcomes* panel in the *Form* properties section, for *CUBA screen* forms the outcomes are defined in the form controller.

image::outcomes-panel.png[]

When an outcome is created we may define a name, a caption and an icon for it:

image::approve-outcome-edit.png[]

When we complete the task, these outcomes will be displayed as buttons in the input dialog window:

image::approval-task-form.png[]

When the user clicks on one of the outcome buttons, the task is completed and the decision is written to a special process variable. The process variable name is built according to the following name pattern: `<user task id>_result`. The variable value holds information about users who completed the task and outcomes they selected.

As an example of how to use outcomes let's take the process:

image::outcomes-application-process.png[]

The *Application approval* task has two outcomes: `approve` and `reject`. We need to specify conditions for sequence flows after the exclusive gateway element.

The first option is to write a condition expression. The second one is to select an outcome from the drop-down list.

Change the *Condition source* to the *Task outcome* and select the task and its outcome in drop-down lists:

image::outcome-sequence-flow-dropdown.png[]

If the user task is a multi-instance task then you'll need to specify an additional parameter for a sequence flow condition:

This parameter is *Condition type*. It has several possible values:

* Anyone completed with the outcome.
* Everyone completed with the outcome.
* No one completed with the outcome.

image::outcome-sequence-flow-dropdown-multi-instance.png[]

For the screenshot above, the process will continue its execution using this sequence flow only if all of the parallel approvers completed the task with the `approve` outcome.

[[pools-and-lanes]]
== Pools and Lanes

If the process model uses pools and lanes then assignees can be defined not for individual user tasks, but for lanes.

image::order-process-lanes.png[]

If you select the lane, e.g. *Manager* then you'll be able to define an assignee for the lane:

image::lane-properties-panel.png[]

All user tasks on the lane without explicitly defined assignee will inherit the assignee value from the lane.

To display and edit process properties click on the *pool* element.

[[user-groups]]
== User Groups

User groups are managed using the *BProc > User groups* screen. A single user may be a member of many groups. A group can have one of the following types:

* *Users*. For the group of *Users* type users should be explicitly selected.
* *Roles*. For the group of *Roles* type a set of security roles should be defined. Users are considered to be a member of the user group if they have one of the selected roles.
* *All users*. Group of this type will automatically contain all users.

image::accountants-user-group-edit.png[]

[[service-task]]
== Service Task

Flowable engine gives you the following ways to declare how Java logic for the service task should be invoked:

* Specifying a class that implements `JavaDelegate` or `ActivityBehavior`.
* Evaluating an expression that resolves to a delegation object.
* Invoking a method expression.

See link:{flowable_doc_url}#bpmnJavaServiceTask[Java Service Task] in Flowable docs for details.

[[spring-bean-service-task]]
=== Spring Bean Service Task

*BProc* add-on adds one more way to define a service task. It allows you to select a Spring bean, the bean method and provide parameter values for the selected method. Bean name and methods are selected from drop-down lists. After a method is selected a panel for entering method argument values is displayed.

image::service-task-bean-properties.png[]

The panel for the Spring bean helps to build an expression for bean method invocation. In case of method from the screenshot above, the expression will be:

....
${ref_VacancyService.publishOnWebsite('Java Developer', fileVar)}
....

Pay attention to the *is var* check box. It makes sense mostly for string parameters. If the check box is not selected then the argument value will be written to the resulting expression in apostrophes. If the check box is selected the no apostrophes will be added and a variable with a provided name will be passed to the method.

`${ref_MyBean.someMethod('description')}` - this expression will use the *string value* description to the method.

`${ref_MyBean.someMethod(description)}` - this expression will use the *value of the variable* named description to the method.

[[java-delegate-service-task]]
=== Java Delegate Service Task

If you select the `JavaDelegate class` in the *Type* lookup then the *JavaDelegate class* drop down list field will appear. The list will contain a list of classes that implement the `org.flowable.engine.delegate.JavaDelegate` interface. See link:{flowable_doc_url}#bpmnJavaServiceTaskImplementation[Java Service Task Implementation] section of the Flowable documentation.

If the selected JavaDelegate class contains fields of `org.flowable.common.engine.api.delegate.Expression` type (see link:{flowable_doc_url}#serviceTaskFieldInjection[Field Injection] in Flowable documentation) then field names will appear in the `Fields` table.

Here is an example of a Java class that sends an email:

.SendEmailJavaDelegate.java
[source, java]
----
public class SendEmailJavaDelegate implements JavaDelegate {

    private Expression addressee; <1>
    private Expression emailSubject;
    private Expression emailBody;

    private static Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SendEmailJavaDelegate.class);

    @Override
    public void execute(DelegateExecution execution) { <2>
        User addresseeValue = (User) addressee.getValue(execution); <3>
        if (addresseeValue == null || Strings.isNullOrEmpty(addresseeValue.getEmail())) {
            log.error("Cannot evaluate addressee email");
            return;
        }
        String emailSubjectValue = (String) emailSubject.getValue(execution);
        String emailBodyValue = (String) emailBody.getValue(execution);
        EmailService emailService = AppBeans.get(EmailService.class);
        emailService.sendEmailAsync(new EmailInfo(addresseeValue.getEmail(),
                emailSubjectValue,
                emailBodyValue));
    }
}
----
<1> We declare three fields. Values of the fields are defined in the process model.
<2> The `execute` method is invoked when the process reaches the service task.
<3> Evaluate the value of the expression.

The properties panel for the service task will look this way:

image::java-delegate-properties-panel.png[]

Field editor:

image::java-delegate-field-edit.png[]

For the `addressee` field we select the `expression` field type. In our example the `manager` process variable contains a user.

[[model-drafts]]
== Model Drafts

When you click the *Deploy process* button in the model editor, the process will be deployed to the Flowable engine and will be available for starting. If you don't want it to be deployed and just want to save the process to get back to it later, then you can do it use the *Save draft* button. To open a draft use the *Open draft* button.

image::modeler-buttons-panel.png[]

[[event-listener]]
== Event Listeners

When you need to get notified of some process engine event (task assigned, activity completed etc.) there are several approaches.

First, you may define an execution listener or a task listener for the particular process node. See the link:{flowable_doc_url}#executionListeners[Execution Listener] section of Flowable documentation for details. In the execution listener editor, the drop-down list for selecting a class contains classes that implement the `org.flowable.engine.delegate.ExecutionListener` interface. In case of task listener there are classes implementing `org.flowable.engine.delegate.TaskListener` there. If the class contains link:{flowable_doc_url}#executionListenerFieldInjection[injected fields] then these fields will be automatically added to the *Fields* section of the listener editor.

Second, you can declare global event listeners provided by the Flowable framework (see the link:{flowable_doc_url}#eventDispatcher[Event handlers] in Flowable documentation). You'll find the *Event listeners* section on the project properties panel. 

*BProc* add-on additionally introduces a set of Spring application events (see the link:{cuba_doc_url}/events.html[Events] section in CUBA documentation). The following events are published:

* UserTaskAssignedEvent
* UserTaskCreatedEvent
* UserTaskCompletedEvent
* ActivityStartedEvent
* ActivityCompletedEvent
* ProcessStartedEvent
* ProcessCompletedEvent

Here is an example of event listener that sends an email notification each time a user task is assigned to a user:

.TaskAssignedNotificationSender
[source, java]
----
@Component(TaskAssignedNotificationSender.NAME)
public class TaskAssignedNotificationSender {

    public static final String NAME = "ref_TaskAssignedNotificationSender";

    @Inject
    protected EmailService emailService;

    @EventListener <1>
    protected void onTaskAssigned(UserTaskAssignedEvent event) { <2>
        User user = event.getUser(); <3>
        TaskData taskData = event.getTaskData(); <4>
        String emailTitle = "New process task " + taskData.getName();
        String emailBodyTemplatePath = "com/haulmont/bproc/ref/notification/task-email-body.template";
        Map<String, Serializable> templateParameters = new HashMap<>();
        templateParameters.put("user", user);
        templateParameters.put("taskData", taskData);
        EmailInfo emailInfo = new EmailInfo(
                user.getEmail(),
                emailTitle,
                null,
                emailBodyTemplatePath,
                templateParameters
        );
        emailService.sendEmailAsync(emailInfo); <5>
    }
}
----
<1> Declares that the method is an event listener.
<2> The listener is fired each time the `UserTaskAssignedEvent` is published.
<3> The `UserTaskAssignedEvent` contains an information about the user who is assigned to the task.
<4> The `UserTaskAssignedEvent` contains a `TaskData` object which holds an information about the user task.
<5> See the link:{cuba_doc_url}/sending_emails_recipe.html[Email Sending Guide] for details.

The email body template may be as follows:

.task-email-body.template
[source]
----
Hi ${user.name}!
The task "${taskData.name}" has been assigned.
----

If you need to get a process variable value in the listener you can do it this way:
[source, java]
----
Order order = (Order) bprocRuntimeService.getVariable(event.getTaskData().getExecutionId(), "order");
----

By default, the listener is fired when the user task is assigned in any process. If you want to send notifications only for specific process definition you can either check the process definition in the listener method body:

[source, java]
----
@EventListener
protected void onOtherProcessTaskAssigned(UserTaskAssignedEvent event) {
    if ("some-process".equals(event.getProcessDefinitionData().getKey())) {
        // ...
    }
}
----

or you may define a SpEL (Spring Expression Language) expression that should match in order to handle the event:

[source, java]
----
@EventListener(condition = "#event.processDefinitionData.key == 'some-process'")
protected void onOtherProcessTaskAssigned(UserTaskAssignedEvent event) {
    // ...
}
----

[[administration-screens]]
== Administration Screens

[[process-definitions-screen]]
=== Process Definitions Screen

Process definition editor displays process definition entity properties, BPMN XML, active process instances of the selected process definition version. To change the process definition version use the *Version* lookup field.

From the editor, you also can suspend the process definition (the process will not be available for starting until you activate it). In the suspend process definition dialog, you have an option to suspend running process instances as well. In this case, user tasks of suspended instances won't be displayed in the tasks list, all timers and jobs won't be executed.

image::process-definition-edit.png[]

Read the <<process-instances-migration>> section to get information about process instances migration.

[[process-instances-screen]]
=== Process Instances Screen

Process instances browser screen may display both active and completed process instances. To switch between them, change the value of the *State* lookup in the filter and click the *Apply* button.

In the process instance editor, using actions buttons, you can <<process-instances-migration,migrate>> an instance to a new process definition version, suspend an instance or remove it at all.

The *Runtime* tab is available only for active process instances and contains information about current process state: active user tasks, execution tree, variable values, failed jobs.

image::process-instance-edit.png[]

Selecting items in executions tree will modify content of *Variables* and *Tasks* tabs. If you select a particular execution, only objects related to this execution will be displayed .

Using the *Variables* tab You can create, modify and remove process variables. Note, that when you create a new process variable it will be put to the selected execution (if selected).

image::process-instance-create-variable.png[]

Using the *User tasks* tab you can view a list of active tasks and reassign tasks to other users.

The *Failed jobs* tab displays the list of jobs that failed with an error. For example, if some service task method threw an exception, this service task will appear in the failed jobs list. From the UI you will be able to see the exception stacktrace and restore the failed job after the cause of the error is fixed.

image::failed-job-edit.png[]

The *History* tab contains history information: a list of all user tasks (completed and active), a full list of completed activities and last values of process variables. The *History* tab is available both for active and for completed process instances.

[[user-tasks-screen]]
=== User Tasks Screen

The screen displays all active user tasks. On the top of the screen, you can filter tasks using various criteria: process definition, task assignee, task candidate, etc.

With the help of this screen you can, for example, find all tasks assigned to a user and reassign them all to another person.

image::all-user-tasks-screen.png[]

[[process-instances-migration]]
== Process Instances Migration

After a process model is modified and a new process definition version is deployed, all existing process instances continue using an older version of the process definition. If necessary you can migrate them to the new process definition version.

If you need to migrate all process instances, open the process definition editor, select a required version in the lookup field and click the *Migrate all instances* button. Before the migration is performed, all instances are validated, and if any instance cannot be migrated, information window is displayed.

To migrate a single instance, find it in the *Process Instances* screen, open the *Process Instance Editor* and click the *Migrate* button.

For more details about the process instance migration see the link:{flowable_doc_url}#_process_instance_migration_experimental[Process Instance Migration] section of the Flowable documentation.

[[bproc-api]]
== BProc API

The Flowable engine is added as a dependency to the *core* module of BProc add-on (see link:{cuba_doc_url}/app_modules.html[Application Modules] of CUBA Manual). This means that the code in the *core* module can use the link:{flowable_doc_url}#chapterApi[Flowable API] directly.

In the *web* module the Flowable API is not available. If you need to work with a process from the *web* module, e.g. from a screen controller, you should use the BProc API (this API is also available in the *core* module, so it can be used everywhere). BProc API is very similar to the Flowable API, many of its methods repeat contracts of Flowable services and invoke Flowable services under the hood.

BProc provides the following services:

* `BprocRepositoryService`
* `BprocRuntimeService`
* `BprocTaskService`
* `BprocFormService`
* `BprocHistoricService`
* `BprocManagementService`

[[starting-the-process-programmatically]]
=== Starting the Process Programmatically

You may want to start processes not from the *Start Process* screen, but from the regular entity editor. Let's say, we have the `Order` entity editor. The `Order` entity has the `manager` field of the `User` type. In the process we're going to start, some user task should be assigned to the order manager, so we must store the manager in a proper process variable. To start the process use the `BprocRuntimeService`.

If the order editor screen has a button with an id `startProcessBtn`, then a button click listener that starts the process will look like this:

[source, java]
----
@Subscribe("startProcessBtn")
protected void onStartProcessBtnClick(Button.ClickEvent event) {
    Order order = getEditedEntity();
    Map<String, Object> processVariables = new HashMap<>();
    processVariables.put("orderId", order.getId()); <1>
    processVariables.put("approver", order.getManager()); <2>
    bprocRuntimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey( <3>
            "order-approval", <4>
            order.getNumber(),  <5>
            processVariables); <6>
}
----
<1> We put an edited entity id to the process variable with the `orderId` name. Later we will be able to find the related process instance and user tasks using this variable value.
<2> The `approver` variable is used for the user task assignment.
<3> To start the process we use the `BprocRuntimeService`.
<4> `order-approval` is the process definition key.
<5> The order number is used as an optional process instance business key. It is not required to use business keys in general case.
<6> The third method argument is a process variables map (contains an order id and the approver user).

[[getting-a-list-of-process-instances]]
=== Getting a List of Process Instances

The next snippet can be used inside the order entity editor to get a list of process instances of `order-approval` definition related to the edited order entity. The `orderId` variable should store the order id. It may be passed, for example, on process start (see the <<starting-the-process-programmatically>> section).

[source, java]
----
Order order = getEditedEntity();
List<ProcessInstanceData> processInstances = bprocRuntimeService.createProcessInstanceDataQuery()
    .processDefinitionKey("order-approval")
    .variableValueEquals("orderId", order.getId())
    .list();
----

TIP: The `ProcessInstanceData` is a not-persistent platform `Entity`, it can be displayed in standard UI components, i.e. in a `Table` or a `DataGrid`.

[[getting-a-list-of-user-tasks]]
=== Getting a List of User Tasks

The next snippet demonstrates how to get a list of user tasks of the `order-approval` process, that are assigned to the current user and are related to the edited `Order` entity:

[source, java]

=== Complete a User Task

An example how to complete a user task from the code:

[source, java]
----
bprocTaskService.completeWithOutcome(tasksData, // TaskData instance
    "approve",  // outcome
    processVariables); // process variables map

[[automatic-models-deployment]]
== Automatic Models Deployment

BPMN processes and DMN tables may be automatically deployed on application startup. 

* `bproc.flowable.autoDeployBpmnResourcesLocationPattern` database application property defines the filter for searching BPMN models. The default property value is

```
classpath*:bproc/model/bpmn/**/*.bpmn20.xml
```

This means that all files with names ending with `.bpmn20.xml` and located under the `bproc/model/bpmn` package of the *core* module will be deployed when the application is started.

* `bproc.flowable.autoDeployDmnResourcesLocationPattern` database application property defines the filter for searching DMN table models. The default value is

```
classpath*:bproc/model/dmn/**/*.dmn.xml
```

This means that all files with names ending with `.dmn.xml` and located under the `bproc/model/dmn` package of the *core* module will be deployed when the application is started.

Only files that were modified since last application start will be deployed.

[[dmn]]
== DMN

An introduction to DMN can be found in  link:{flowable_dmn_doc_url}[Flowable DMN documentation]. 

*BProc* add-on provides a decision table modeler that can be found under the *BProc -> Decision Table Modeler* menu. 

image::decision-table-editor.png[]

In the model editor, you can add new input and output columns, edit column variable names, types and captions.

image::decision-table-input-definition-edit.png[]

Using the action buttons panel you can deploy the decision table to the DMN engine or save the table definition draft if you wish to continue working on it later.

In the input entries expressions the `==` operator may be omitted. Also, don't forget to wrap string values in input entries expressions in double quotes.

The decision table result will be stored in the corresponding process variable. Properties panel of sequence flow element in the BPMN modeler has an interface for working with decision table results.

You can select a business rule task, its output variable and possible values from drop-down lists.

[[process-engine-configuration]]
== Process Engine Configuration

You can configure the Flowable process engine by handing the `BeforeProcessEngineInitEvent` application event. The event is fired before the process engine is built and started. You need to get an instance of the `ProcessEngineConfiguration` from the event and define required settings there.

[source, java]
----
@Component("qs_MyEngineInitializer")
public class MyEngineInitializer {

    @EventListener <1>
    public void onBeforeProcessEngineInit(BeforeProcessEngineInitEvent event) {
        ProcessEngineConfiguration processEngineConfiguration = event.getProcessEngineConfiguration(); <2>
        ((ProcessEngineConfigurationImpl) processEngineConfiguration).setAsyncExecutorNumberOfRetries(1); <3>
    }
}
----
<1> A listener for the `BeforeProcessEngineInitEvent` event. See link:{cuba_doc_url}/events.html#bean_events[Event handling in beans] in CUBA documentation.
<2> Get the `ProcessEngineConfiguration` from the event instance.
<3> Configure the process engine. E.g. set the number of times a job will be retried before it is moved to the deadletter table.
